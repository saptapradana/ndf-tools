# GPU Partition Calculator

## Description
The GPU Partition Calculator is a web-based tool designed to assist in the efficient allocation of VRAM across multiple GPUs. This tool allows users to input the VRAM capacity and count of multiple GPUs, calculate estimations for partitioning, and visualize the partition results.

## Features
- **Add GPU**: Allows users to add multiple GPUs by specifying their VRAM capacity and count.
- **Partition Calculation**: Automatically calculates and displays partition estimations based on the total VRAM.
- **Visual Results**: Displays detailed partition results with start and end points for each GPU.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Web browser (modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Usage

1. **Adding GPUs**:  
   - Click "Tambah GPU" to add a new GPU.
   - Enter the VRAM and the number of GPUs.
   
2. **Calculation**:  
   - After adding GPUs, click "Hitung" to calculate and display the partition results.

3. **Results**:  
   - The results table shows GPU IDs, VRAM, partition start, and partition end values.

4. **View Estimations**:  
   - Use the "cek" button to view estimation results based on the VRAM provided for each GPU.
